			<h3>Week 2 Learnings</h3>
				<p>Delved deeper into git commands and javascript.  Started team projects and learned the basics of working with a group to cooperatively create a website.  Learned the keyframe rotate CSS animation and how to synchronize an input range with a number value. Started writing functions with javascript, including for loops, forEach, switch statements. How to link a function to create contents of the html by equating it all to a variable that writes to the document. Started working with pull requests and merging to the master of github and local master.</p>

			<h3>Week 3 Learnings</h3>
				<p>Week 3 introduced several new concepts as well as solidified previous elements that I have been working with. I began to work with event listeners more in depth. I was taught the fundamentals of Sass and what it is used for and that it entails creating a mirror-type css sheet for your projects. I learned about Bootstrap and Materialize, two frameworks that are commonly used in styling amongst developers.  I learned more about javascript in properly creating functions and I improved my understanding of these elements. I was also introduced to array method chaining in single page applications.</p>

			<h3>Week 4 Learnings</h3>
				<p>This week I began to learn the fundamentals of single page applications.  We were introduced to advanced functions, array functions, event listeners, XHR's, and IIFE's.  We completed a group project creating a simple translation platform for multiple languages.  I learned more about the way functions work and more advanced properties of arrays, event listeners, and objects.  The basics are now being utilized at a more advanced level and my coding is becoming complex.</p>

			<h3>Week 5 Learnings</h3>
				<p>Final week in the single page application milestone. This week was the most difficult for me so far. I feel like I am behind in learning about IIFE's and object augmentation.  I learned more about XHR requests and how to create projects (like Seasonal Sales) that modified item prices according to certain attributes or id's. I worked with string manipulation and advanced array methods.  I also completed projects that included function callbacks and parsing data from JSON files.  My learning has continued to grow in all aspects of coding. I need to study more about IIFEs, augmentation, and how to use Sass. I am concerned about my comprehension of these subjects.</p>
